 We no longer have a team of bell ringers in our village. What do we do to ensure that the bells remain in good order?&amp;quot;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is complex, as it depends on many factors: the number of times they may be rung and for how long; frequency and quality of past maintenance and inspections; age/type of the installation (old-style or modern); whether belfry and tower is generally well maintained; enthusiasm of &lt;a href="../glossary/#tower-authority"&gt;the tower authority&lt;/a&gt;; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bells in Your Care</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/communication/yourcare/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/communication/yourcare/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="bells-in-your-care"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sound of church bells ringing out can provide very loud evidence of the existence of an active church with an active congregation and you are fortunate to have bells in your care. Ringers and the &lt;a href="docs/glossary/#cccbr"&gt;CCCBR&lt;/a&gt; can help with anything you need to know.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a brief summary.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Frequently Asked Questions</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/communication/faqs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/communication/faqs/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="frequently-asked-questions"&gt;
 Frequently Asked Questions

&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are some questions that are often asked by bell ringers.&lt;/strong&gt;
The answers are based on &lt;a href="docs/glossary/#church-of-england"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; practice, so may vary elsewhere across the world and denominations. The following was written by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://guildofclericalringers.org.uk/"&gt;The Guild of Clerical Ringers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in 2020, and was previously published as a .pdf file on the &lt;a href="docs/glossary/#cccbr"&gt;CCCBR&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Guidance Note offers advice to individual ringers, ringing organisations, &lt;a href="docs/glossary/#pcc"&gt;Parochial Church Councils&lt;/a&gt; and clergy regarding factors to consider regarding insurance while ringing tower bells and in other issues related to ringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most tower bells come under the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href="docs/glossary/#church-of-england"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt;, so this Guidance Note has been produced with this in mind. However, most of the principles addressed will apply to Churches of other denominations and bells outside church ownership and / or control, including those outside the UK. Where appropriate, advice relevant to the specific circumstances must be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Data Protection Guidance</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/formalities/gdpr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/formalities/gdpr/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="data-protection-guidance"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GDPR was applicable in EU member states from 25 May 2018. It did not require national legislation to be implemented and when the UK left the EU, the GDPR - like other directly applicable EU legislation - became part of the UK’s domestic law under the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. The Data Protection Bill replaced the 1998 Data Protection Act (DPA), incorporates the GDPR and the Law Enforcement Directive into UK law and deals with permitted derogations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Health &amp; Safety Policy</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/healthsafetypolicy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/healthsafetypolicy/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="health--safety"&gt;

 Advice for Bell Ringers
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#advice-for-bell-ringers"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document aims to help bell ringing societies/guilds/associations prepare a Health and Safety Policy for all activities of the society. (In these notes, the word society’ will be used regardless of the title of the society, guild or association concerned.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under common law, voluntary organisations and individual volunteers have a ‘duty of care’ to each other and to those who may be affected by their activities. It is therefore good practice for a society to have a written Health and Safety Policy. Some insurers, for example, may ask for evidence of how a society considers Health and Safety matters. These notes will consider only societies with no paid employees. (Note that the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 requires businesses employing 5 or more people to prepare a written Health and Safety Policy. Outside England and Wales, other laws and terminology may be applicable.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Risk Assessment</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/riskassessment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/riskassessment/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="risk-assessment-guidance"&gt;

 Introduction
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#introduction"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These notes offer advice about issues to consider in a health and safety risk assessment of the bells and tower prior to the bells being rung after an extended period (several months or more) during which they have not been rung.
This could concern a single bell, manual chimes or change ringing bells.
The notes were first compiled to aid ringers to return to towers to ring bells when restrictions due to Covid-19 were eased, but are applicable after other periods of non-use for whatever reason.
The notes may assist the &lt;a href="docs/glossary/#tower-authority"&gt;tower authority&lt;/a&gt; and bell ringers; they do not intend to provide comprehensive information about health and safety or risk assessments generally.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fire Protection</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/fireprevention/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/fireprevention/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="fire-protection-and-risk-assessment"&gt;

Few towers were designed or built to comply with current legislation and many are extremely historic and vulnerable structures.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how comfortable and well equipped your ringing room or how excellent the go of the bells, if you can&amp;rsquo;t reach them safely they&amp;rsquo;re not much use to you. For that reason it is well worth considering the state of the access route to the tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All towers are different and each will present a corresponding set of unique circumstances which will affect the decisions made with regard to the access route. The access to the tower is not, of course, the sole province of the ringers but of church-wardens, electricians, bell hangers, masons and sometimes visiting members of the public. As such it is necessary to bear in mind the needs of all users of the tower and to remember that access to the upper reaches of the tower should be as well maintained and as carefully designed as the access to the ringing room.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ringing Boxes</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/ringingroom/boxes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/ringingroom/boxes/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="ringing-boxes"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ringing boxes are one of the ubiquitous but often despised necessities of ringing. They are often heavy, they take up space in a ringing room which, in most cases, has little enough space to begin with and many ringers don&amp;rsquo;t like using them anyway. However they are not going away and a well designed and neatly made box will do much to improve the perception of boxes in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lighting</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/ringingroom/lighting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/ringingroom/lighting/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="lighting"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This note offers advice to ringers and churches about the appointment of the ‘Tower Captain’ in a church with bells. The person appointed may not be called the ‘Tower Captain’ in all towers – ‘Ringing Master’ is another title that is often used, or that may be used for another person with different responsibilities. In this note, the words ‘Tower Captain’ will be used even if local terminology is different from this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Planning ringing</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/buildingateam/planning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/buildingateam/planning/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="planning-ringing"&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="book-hint info"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REMEMBER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all ringers will arrive on time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow for greeting, hanging up coats, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bells may have to be raised and lowered which may take up to 15 minutes and reduce the time to achieve aims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to give everyone at least one piece of useful and satisfying ringing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximate timings of touches (used here to mean any piece of ringing):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;120 changes of Doubles or Minor takes 4-5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4-5 minutes is a suitable time for rounds and call changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On 8, or more, pieces will generally be longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow 2-3 minutes to change over between pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 Plan Ahead
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#plan-ahead"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of the time available plan at least one touch ahead.

&lt;p&gt;A ringing outing can be an enjoyable and useful way of introducing ringers to a wider variety of bells than they might otherwise encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can help those involved to improve bell control and ringing skills, as it is like having multiple practices in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it is a very good way of getting the ringers together socially.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
