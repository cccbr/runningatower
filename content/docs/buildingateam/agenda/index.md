# Draft Agenda

The following is an annotated draft of an agenda. A version of this, without the annotation, [can be downloaded here](proforma.docx).

# Agenda for Annual Meeting of XXXX ringers at XXXX on DATE at TIME   

## Prayers and opening remarks.  

Prayers are probably only relevant if the tower is part of a religious institution. If it is and a member of the clergy is present, they will perform this and may chair the meeting. If the chair is from the [tower authority](docs/glossary/#tower authority), and possibly not a ringer, they may provide feedback on a more public basis. 

## Apologies for absence.  

Ideally, these should be obtained in advance. 

## Minutes of previous meeting.  

A good idea is to circulate these beforehand, allowing attendees to remind themselves of the previous meeting as this may be some time ago. Consider how minutes are archived. If they are held on an individual’s computer, they may not be accessible when the secretary changes. 

## Matters arising (and not covered by the agenda). 

This is to update on any issues outstanding from the previous meeting and to correct any errors. Formally, minutes are signed by the chair. 

## Reports from Officers.  

The following are, probably, the minimum that an active society should have - Ringing Master, Secretary, Treasurer, Steeple Keeper. A society may have other offices which require a report to be given to the membership e.g. social secretary. 

## Election of Officers.  

The following is given as a suggestion and is not definitive. The society, together with the [tower authority](../170-glossary/#tower authority), may decide on additional offices. The following are the, probably, the minimum that an active society should have 
- Ringing Master
- Deputy Ringing Master
- Secretary
- Treasurer
- Steeple Keeper. 

These are recommendations to the [tower authority](../170-glossary/#tower authority) for their approval. 

## Review of membership.  

- Election of new members
- Updates to the tower constitution and members’ Code of Conduct. 
- This item may be used to record thanks to previous members, congratulations, condolences, etc. 
- This item also offers the opportunity for members to be reminded of the tower’s approach to GDPR for the retention of their personal details, and that Equality and Diversity are topics to be respected. Particular attention must be made for members under 18 for their parental engagement. 

## Safeguarding.  

The person with responsibility, in the tower, should be invited to report and update. It should include requirements for training. 

## Health and Safety.  

The person with responsibility, in the tower, should be invited to report and update. It should include requirements for tower risk assessment, emergency procedures, insurance provision, requirements for training, etc.  

## Financial Matters 

This covers:
- Tower and society subscriptions. 
- Proposals for fees for weddings, special occasions, visiting bands, quarter peals, peals, etc. 
- Funding for routine maintenance and any special projects.
- If a ring-fenced account is in use, any changes to the conditions.
