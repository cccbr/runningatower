&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sound of church bells ringing out can provide very loud evidence of the existence of an active church with an active congregation and you are fortunate to have bells in your care. Ringers and the &lt;a href="docs/glossary/#cccbr"&gt;CCCBR&lt;/a&gt; can help with anything you need to know.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a brief summary.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Frequently Asked Questions</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/communication/faqs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/communication/faqs/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="frequently-asked-questions"&gt;
 Frequently Asked Questions
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#frequently-asked-questions"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are some questions that are often asked by bell ringers.&lt;/strong&gt;
The answers are based on &lt;a href="docs/glossary/#church-of-england"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; practice, so may vary elsewhere across the world and denominations. The following was written by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://guildofclericalringers.org.uk/"&gt;The Guild of Clerical Ringers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in 2020, and was previously published as a .pdf file on the &lt;a href="docs/glossary/#cccbr"&gt;CCCBR&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is worth distinguishing between clergy status and clergy roles.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
